# Blinkit Clone – Grocery Delivery Frontend Website
This is a frontend clone of Blinkit, an Indian instant delivery service app that delivers groceries and daily essentials in minutes. Built using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome, this project replicates the UI of Blinkit’s home page with responsive design and interactive components.
